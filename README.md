D2X lets teams deliver repeatable, composable Salesforce products and solutions.

D2X defines a container image for Salesforce development, build, and delivery using CumulusCI and Salesforce CLI. This gives teams a cconsistent runtime environment for automation used in across the entire software product lifecycle.

MuseLab created D2X as the framework for all of our services engagements, and we are proud to share it freely with the entire Salesforce ecosystem.

More details on using D2X — and contributing it to it! — coming soon!
